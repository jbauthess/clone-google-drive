# clone-google-drive
A tool for cloning a google drive locally.

This tool parses the full target google drive and replicate the files locally using the same folder tree as on drive. Files using specific google formats (google doc, ...) can not be downloaded as it. Instead they are exported to a compatible format (word, ...).
